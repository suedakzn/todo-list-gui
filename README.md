# 📝 To-Do List GUI Application (Python + Tkinter)

This is a desktop to-do list application that I developed using **Python** and the **Tkinter** GUI library.  
The goal of this project was to combine functionality with a clean and user-friendly design. Tasks can be added, completed, or deleted, and are saved persistently in a JSON file.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Add, complete, and delete tasks easily
- 📂 All tasks are stored persistently in a `JSON` file
- 🎨 Light/Dark theme switch (clickable button)
- 🧾 Tasks are divided into **To-Do** and **Completed**
- 📊 Task counter showing how many tasks are remaining/completed
- 🖱️ Stylish interface with custom-colored buttons and icons

## 📁 Project Structure

```
todo-list-gui/
├── todo.py               # Task management class
├── todo_gui.py           # GUI interface and app logic

## 🎯 Why I Built This

I wanted to solidify my Python skills by creating a simple but polished GUI application.  
This project allowed me to explore Tkinter, event-driven programming, and file operations in Python — and it’s a great addition to my portfolio for internship applications.
